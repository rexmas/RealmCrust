#Requirements
iOS 8.0+
Swift 2.1+

#Installation
### CocoaPods
```
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Crust'
```

#Structs and Classes
Can map to/from classes or structs
```swift
class Company : Mappable {
        
    var employees = Array<Employee>()
    var uuid: String = ""
    var name: String = ""
    var foundingDate: NSDate = NSDate()
    var founder: Employee?
    var pendingLawsuits: Int = 0
}
```
If you have no need for storage, which will generaly be the case for structs, use `AnyMappable`.
```swift
struct Person : AnyMappable {
    
    var bankAccounts: Array<Int> = [ 1234, 5678 ]
    var attitude: String = "awesome"
    var hairColor: HairColor = .Unknown
    var ownsCat: Bool? = nil
}
```

#Separation of Concerns

By design Crust is built with [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) in mind. It makes no assumptions about how many ways a user would like to map to and from JSON and how many various ways the user would like to store their models.

Crust has 3 basic protocols:
- `Mappable`
	- The model (class or struct) to be mapped to and from JSON.
- `Mapping`
	- How to map JSON to and from a particular `Mappable` model.
	- May include primary key(s) and nested mapping(s).
- `Adaptor`
	- How to store and retrieve model objects used for mapping from a backing store (e.g. Core Data, Realm, etc.).

There are no limitations on the number of various `Mapping`s and `Adaptor`s one may create per `Mappable` model for different use cases.

#JSONValue for type safe JSON
Crust relies on [JSONValue](https://github.com/rexmas/JSONValue) for it's JSON encoding and decoding mechanism. It offers many benefits including type safety, subscripting, and extensibility through protocols.

#How To Map

1. Create your mappings for your model using `Mapping` if with storage or `AnyMapping` if without storage.

    With storage (assume `CoreDataAdaptor` conforms to `Adaptor`)
    ```swift
    class EmployeeMapping : Mapping {
    
        var adaptor: CoreDataAdaptor
        var primaryKeys: Array<CRMappingKey> {
            return [ "uuid" ]
        }

        required init(adaptor: CoreDataAdaptor) {
            self.adaptor = adaptor
        }
    
        func mapping(inout tomap: Employee, context: MappingContext) {
            // Company must be transformed into something Core Data can use in this case.
            let companyMapping = CompanyTransformableMapping()
        
            tomap.employer              <- .Mapping("company", companyMapping) >*<
            tomap.uuid                  <- "uuid" >*<
            tomap.name                  <- "data.name" >*<
            context
        }
    }
    ```
    Without storage
    ```swift
    class CompanyMapping : AnyMapping {
        // typealias MappedObject = Company is inferred by `tomap`
    
        func mapping(inout tomap: Company, context: MappingContext) {
            let employeeMapping = EmployeeMapping(adaptor: CoreDataAdaptor())
        
            tomap.employees             <- .Mapping("employees", employeeMapping) >*<
            tomap.founder               <- .Mapping("founder", employeeMapping) >*<
            tomap.uuid                  <- "uuid" >*<
            tomap.name                  <- "name" >*<
            tomap.foundingDate          <- "data.founding_date"  >*<
            tomap.pendingLawsuits       <- "data.lawsuits.pending"  >*<
            context
        }
    }
    ```

2. Create your Crust Mapper.
    ```swift
    let mapper = CRMapper()<Company, CompanyMapping>
    ```

3. Use the mapper to convert to and from `JSONValue` objects
    ```swift
    let json = try! JSONValue(object: [
                "uuid" : "uuid123",
                "name" : "name",
                "employees" : [
                    [ "name" : "Fred", "uuid" : "ABC123" ],
                    [ "name" : "Wilma", "uuid" : "XYZ098" ]
                ]
                "founder" : NSNull(),
                "data" : [
                    "lawsuits" : [
                        "pending" : 5
                    ]
                ],
                "data.founding_date" : NSDate().toISOString(),
            ]
    )
    let company = try! mapper.mapFromJSONToNewObject(json: json, mapping: CompanyMapping())
    ```

NOTE:
`JSONValue` can be converted back to an `AnyObject` variation of json via `json.values()` and to `NSData` via `try! json.encode()`.

###Nested Mappings
Crust supports nested mappings for nested models
E.g. from above
```swift
func mapping(inout tomap: Company, context: MappingContext) {
    let employeeMapping = EmployeeMapping(adaptor: CoreDataAdaptor())
    
    tomap.employees <- KeyExtensions.Mapping("employees", employeeMapping) >*<
    context
}
```

###Mapping Context
Every `mapping` passes through a `context: MappingContext` which must be included during the mapping. The `context` includes error information that is propagated back from the mapping to the caller and contextual information about the json and object being mapped to/from.

There are two ways to include the context during mapping:

1. Include it as a tuple.

   ```swift
   func mapping(inout tomap: Company, context: MappingContext) {
       tomap.uuid <- ("uuid", context)
       tomap.name <- ("name", context)
   }
   ```
2. Use a specially included operator `>*<` which merges the result of the right expression with the left expression into a tuple. This may be chained in succession.

   ```swift
   func mapping(inout tomap: Company, context: MappingContext) {
       tomap.uuid <- "uuid" >*<
       tomap.name <- "name" >*<
       context
   }
   ```

###Custom Transformations
To create a simple custom transformation (such as to basic value types) implement the `Transform` protocol
```swift
public protocol Transform : AnyMapping {
    func fromJSON(json: JSONValue) throws -> MappedObject
    func toJSON(obj: MappedObject) -> JSONValue
}
```
and use it like any other `Mapping`.

###Different Mappings for Same Model
Multiple `Mapping`s are allowed for the same model.
```swift
class CompanyMapping : AnyMapping {
    func mapping(inout tomap: Company, context: MappingContext) {
        tomap.uuid <- "uuid" >*<
        tomap.name <- "name" >*<
        context
    }
}

class CompanyMappingWithNameUUIDReversed : AnyMapping {
	func mapping(inout tomap: Company, context: MappingContext) {
        tomap.uuid <- "name" >*<
        tomap.name <- "uuid" >*<
        context
    }
}
```
Just use two different mappers.
```swift
let mapper1 = CRMapper<Company, CompanyMapping>()
let mapper2 = CRMapper<Company, CompanyMappingWithNameUUIDReversed>()
```

#Storage Adaptor
Follow the `Adaptor` protocol to create a storage adaptor to Core Data, Realm, etc.

The object conforming to `Adaptor` must include two `typealias`s:
- `BaseType` - the top level class for this storage systems model objects.
  - Core Data this would be `NSManagedObject`.
  - Realm this would be `Object`.
- `ResultsType: CollectionType` - Used for object lookups. Should return a collection of `BaseType`s.

The `Mapping` must then set it's `typealias AdaptorKind = <Your Adaptor>` to use it during mapping.
